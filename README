mono-System.Text.UTF8Encoding-test
==================================

This program is built using the Makefile included, which compiles the test
program and generate some test files.

Then it must be executed with a Mono runtime and a MS.NET runtime.

Once execution is finished use the 'mkdiff.sh' shell script for comparing the
output of both runtimes. Two compatible System.Text.UTF8Encoding shouldn't
leave any *.diff file in the 'cnv-diff' directory.
