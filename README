mono-System.Text.UTF8Encoding-test
==================================

This tests are written for testing my patches against mono (see git pull
request https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/622).

The test programs are built using the Makefile included, which compiles the
test program and generate some test files.

They must be executed with a Mono runtime and a MS.NET runtime.

- convert.exe
  Must be executed in both platforms. Once executed put the generated
  directories (cnvout-mono and cnvout-other) in the same folder and run the
  'mkdiff.sh' shell script. This script will compare the output of both
  runtimes. If the two implementations of System.Text.UTF8Encoding are
  compatible then the script shall not leave any *.diff file in the 'cnv-diff'
  directory.

- SomeTest.dll
  It is a NUNIT test. It includes some tests from
  /mono/mcs/class/corlib/Test/System.Text/*.cs and declares two new tests
  (EncoderFallbackExceptions and DecoderFallbackExceptions).
